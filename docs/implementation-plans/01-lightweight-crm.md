# Lightweight CRM Implementation Plan for Donation Platform

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a lightweight CRM system to manage contact records for a donation platform. The system will focus on maintaining accurate contact information and linking it to donor records.

## Core Features

### 1. Contact Management

- **Data Model**:
  - Contact (id, given_name, family_name, email, phone, created_at, updated_at)
  - ContactInfo (id, contact_id, type [email/phone/address], value, is_primary, created_at, updated_at)
  - Employment (id, contact_id, employer, occupation, is_current, start_date, end_date)
  - Address (id, contact_id, street_line_1, street_line_2, locale, region, postal_code, country, is_primary, address_type [home/work/other])

### 2. Donor Integration

- **Data Model**:
  - Donor (id, external_id, created_at, updated_at)
  - ContactDonor (contact_id, donor_id, is_primary, created_at, updated_at)
  - Donation (id, donor_id, amount, currency, donation_date, campaign_id, payment_method, status)

### 3. Contact Record Consolidation

- **Merging Logic**:
  - Identify potential duplicates based on name, email, phone
  - Manual review and merge process
  - History tracking of merged records

## Technical Implementation

### Backend

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - CRUD operations for Contacts
   - Donor linking/unlinking
   - Contact search and filtering
   - Donation history retrieval
   - Contact merging

2. **Services**:
   - ContactService: Handle contact CRUD operations
   - DonorService: Manage donor relationships
   - DeduplicationService: Identify and merge duplicate contacts
   - Import/Export: For bulk operations

### Frontend

1. **Pages**:
   - Contact list with search/filter
   - Contact detail view
   - Contact creation/editing form
   - Donation history view
   - Contact merging interface

2. **Components**:
   - Contact card
   - Donation history table
   - Merge suggestions panel
   - Quick edit forms

## Data Flow

1. **Contact Creation/Update**:
   - User creates/updates contact
   - System validates and saves data
   - Optional: Check for potential duplicates

2. **Donor Linking**:
   - User links existing donor record to contact
   - System creates association
   - Donation history becomes available

3. **Record Consolidation**:
   - System suggests potential duplicates
   - User reviews and confirms merge
   - System combines records, preserving all data

## Security Considerations

- Role-based access control
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Data validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for core logic
2. Integration tests for API endpoints
3. End-to-end tests for critical user flows
4. Performance testing for bulk operations

## Deployment

1. Staging environment for testing
2. Blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
3. Database migrations
4. Monitoring and alerting setup

## Future Enhancements

- Automated duplicate detection
- Bulk import/export functionality
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Integration with email/marketing tools
