## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a lightweight CRM system to manage contact records for a donation platform.

The system will focus on maintaining accurate contact information and linking it to donor records.

## Core Features

- Each contact record is a `hireable` and `reachable`
- Each organization record is a `hireable` and `reachable`
- Each contact and organization can have multiple `ContactInfo` records
- Each contact and organization can have multiple `EmploymentRecord` records
- Each contact and organization can have multiple `Address` records
- Each reachable address can be of type `HomeAddress`, `WorkAddress`, or `OtherAddress`
- Each address is linked to a `Region`
- Each address is linked to a `GooglePlace` (external)
- `Address` records are owned and maintained by the system and once created cannot be edited by the user

## Technical Implementation

### Data Model

Review [the data model document](./02-modeling.md) for more details.

### Contact Merging Logic

- Identify potential duplicates based on name, email, phone
- Manual review and merge process
- History tracking of merged records

### Backend

#### a. API Endpoints

- CRUD operations for Contacts
- Donor linking/unlinking
- Contact search and filtering
- Donation history retrieval
- Contact merging

#### b. Services

- ContactService: Handle contact CRUD operations
- DonorService: Manage donor relationships
- DeduplicationService: Identify and merge duplicate contacts
- Import/Export: For bulk operations

### Frontend

#### a. Pages

- Contact list with search/filter
- Contact detail view
- Contact creation/editing form
- Donation history view
- Contact merging interface

#### b. Components

- Contact card
- Donation history table
- Merge suggestions panel
- Quick edit forms

### Data Flow

#### a. Contact Creation/Update

- User creates/updates contact
- System validates and saves data
- Optional: Check for potential duplicates

#### b. Donor Linking

- User links existing donor record to contact
- System creates association
- Donation history becomes available

#### c. Record Consolidation

- System suggests potential duplicates
- User reviews and confirms merge
- System combines records, preserving all data

## Security Considerations

- Role-based access control
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Data validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for core logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing for bulk operations

## Deployment

- Staging environment for testing
- Blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
- Database migrations
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## Future Enhancements

- Automated duplicate detection
- Bulk import/export functionality
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Integration with email/marketing tools
